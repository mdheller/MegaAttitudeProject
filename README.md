## Overview

This package implements White & Rawlins' (2016) computational model of s(emantic)-selection. Included in the `bin/` directory is a dataset consisting of ordinal acceptability judgments for ~1000 clause-embedding verbs of Englishâ€”with 50 surface-syntactic frames per verb, 5 observations per verb-frame pair.  For a detailed description of the model and the data set as well as details of the item construction and collection methods, please see the following paper:
