## Overview

This data set consists of ordinal acceptability judgments for ~1000 clause-embedding verbs of English â€” with 50 surface-syntactic frames per verb, 5 observations per verb-frame pair.  The data was collected on Amazon's Mechanical Turk using [Turktools](http://turktools.net/).  For a detailed description of the data set, the item construction and collection methods, and discussion of how to use a data set on this scale to address questions in linguistic theory, please see the following paper:

## Notes

* Only participants for which `exclude==True` are included in the analysis in White & Rawlins 2016. The full exclusion procedure is laid out in a paper in preparation.
* A javascript error produced 10 NA values for `response`, none of which affect the same verb-frame pair.
