### What is the MegaAttitude Project?

The MegaAttitude Project aims to investigate the syntax and semantics of clause-embedding predicates at the scale of the entire lexicon. The project has two main components: an experimental component and a computational modeling component.

The experimental component aims to adapt and deploy standard methodologies from experimental linguistics—such as acceptability and veridicality judgments—to item sets of arbitrary size.

The computational modeling component aims to develop methods for analyzing data collected under these experimental protocols that combine insights from both theoretical linguistics and natural language processing.

### What have we released?

The MegaAttitude dataset (v1.0), which is described in [White & Rawlins 2016](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_computational_2016_salt.pdf) was released on October 30, 2016. You can get it [here]({{ site.dataurl }}).

An implementation of the model described in [White & Rawlins 2016](http://aswhite.net/media/papers/white_computational_2016_salt.pdf), as well as various extensions, is available as a pre-release version. You can get it [here]({{ site.codeurl }}) or you can clone the MegaAttitude Project [github repository]({{ site.githuburl }}).
