### What is the MegaAttitude Project?

The MegaAttitude Project aims to investigate the syntax and semantics of clause-embedding predicates at the scale of the entire lexicon. The project has two main components: an experimental component and a computational modeling component.

The experimental component aims to adapt and deploy standard methodologies from experimental linguistics—such as acceptability and veridicality judgments—to item sets of arbitrary size.

The computational modeling component aims to develop methods for analyzing data collected under these experimental protocols that combine insights from both theoretical linguistics and natural language processing.

### What has been released?

The MegaAttitude dataset (v1.0) was released on October 30, 2016. This data set, which you can get it [here]({{ site.dataurl }}), consists of ordinal acceptability judgments for ~1000 clause-embedding verbs of English—with 50 surface-syntactic frames per verb, 5 observations per verb-frame pair.  For a detailed description of the data set as well as details of the item construction and collection methods, see [White & Rawlins 2016]({{ page.saltpaperurl }}).

An implementation of the model described in [White & Rawlins 2016]({{ page.saltpaperurl }}), as well as various extensions, was released on January 1, 2017 as a public beta (v0.1beta0). You can get it [here]({{ site.codeurl }}) or you can clone the MegaAttitude Project [github repository]({{ site.githuburl }}).
